# Welcome

This is my intro repo as there is no other way to put out a word about myself (within GitHub). I joined DIVD in june 2024 as I wanted to touch base again with the real world instead of just writing processes and procedures or working with GRC. 

So thats why I am here. Most of my work is in private repo's not even connected to the internet - hence the intro public repo here. You can google my name if you're into OSINT and read more about me. 

Current projects as of August 2024
- DIVD streaming
- Infrastructure migration
